            <p class="about1">"The ocean is a mysterious place. Even scientist can’t explain all of it’s mystery. Seventy percent of the Earth’s surface is below the ocean, yet 95 percent of it remains unexplored to the human eye". </p>

            <p class="about2">Tsunamis are triggered by seismic events and can, according to the Natural History Museum of Utah, move across the ocean at speeds of 500 miles per hour when the ocean depth is 3.7 miles. These waves are usually unnoticed, as they are only a few inches above the surface. And as the waves move towards land—and the depths shrink—they pick up water and increase in above-surface size (but, thankfully, slow down).</p>

            <p class="about3">For hundreds of years, sailors have reported randomly encountering a strange “milky” cast to the sea as far as the eye can see, but scientists have been unable to explain it—or even know for sure if it was real. In 2006, researchers were actually able to capture a satellite image of a milky sea, and several years later, experiments discovered the glow was likely from bioluminescent bacteria that attract fish in order to be eaten and survive in their guts.</p>
